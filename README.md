# Probability-distribution-implementation

This repository focuses on the implementation of probability distributions and their applications in data science, machine learning, and statistical analysis. It includes both theoretical explanations and Python-based implementations of key distributions.

Key Features:
Discrete Distributions: Implementations of Binomial, Poisson, Geometric, and more.
Continuous Distributions: Explore Normal, Exponential, Uniform, Gamma, Beta, and others.
Visualization: Generate visual representations of probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs).
Parameter Estimation: Fit distributions to data and estimate key parameters.
Statistical Sampling: Generate random samples and analyze their properties.
Applications: Real-world use cases for predictive modeling, hypothesis testing, and simulation.
Repository Highlights:
Python scripts with clear and commented implementations.
Examples to help users understand the practical use of each distribution.
Integration with libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib for efficient computation and visualization.
Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating theoretical and practical concepts.
